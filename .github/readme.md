SillyTavern provides a single unified interface for many LLM APIs (KoboldAI/CPP, Horde, NovelAI, Ooba, Tabby, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Claude, Mistral and more), a mobile-friendly layout, Visual Novel Mode, Automatic1111 & ComfyUI API image generation integration, TTS, WorldInfo (lorebooks), customizable UI, auto-translate, more prompt options than you'd ever want or need, and endless growth potential via third-party extensions.

We have a [Documentation website](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) to answer most of your questions and help you get started.

## What is SillyTavern?

SillyTavern (or ST for short) is a locally installed user interface that allows you to interact with text generation LLMs, image generation engines, and TTS voice models.

Beginning in February 2023 as a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8, SillyTavern now has over 200 contributors and 2 years of independent development under its belt, and continues to serve as a leading software for savvy AI hobbyists.

## Our Vision

1. We aim to empower users with as much utility and control over their LLM prompts as possible. The steep learning curve is part of the fun!
2. We do not provide any online or hosted services, nor programmatically track any user data.
3. SillyTavern is a passion project brought to you by a dedicated community of LLM enthusiasts, and will always be free and open sourced.

## Do I need a powerful PC to run SillyTavern?

The hardware requirements are minimal: it will run on anything that can run NodeJS 18 or higher. If you intend to do LLM inference on your local machine, we recommend a 3000-series NVIDIA graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM, but actual requirements may vary depending on the model and backend you choose to use.
